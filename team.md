The Bright Futures Initiative was co-founded in 2021 by Dr. James Watson, Associate Professor leading the Socio-Environmental Analysis Lab at Oregon State University, and Val Tien-Shin Chang, scholar-activist and environmental artist. BFI aims to bring together visionary people across disciplines to envision brighter future scenarios of the worlds we want and need. Though BFI is in its preliminary phases, James and Val have a strong established background working on related projects. James is a co-founder of The Prediction Lab that solves problems using art, data, math and science to create innovative web-based visualizations and tools. James also leads projects with NASA, NOAA, NSF, doing cutting edge environmental research.

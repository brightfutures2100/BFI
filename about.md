Existential risks like climate change, General Artificial Intelligence, CRISPR gene-editing technologies, and robotization have the potential to end humanity. However, in solving these problems humanity also has the potential to begin a new chapter of unprecedented prosperity. The challenge is that as these risks become more real, people suffer from anxiety, hopelessness, and depression. For example, over half of people aged 16-25 feel “afraid, sad, anxious, angry, powerless, helpless, and/or guilty” about their futures. To find solutions to these millennia-defining challenges, we need to stay hopeful and positive, and to be confident in humanity’s ability to find novel and equitable solutions. We need to fixate all our energies on bright futures where these grand challenges have been solved. 

But what do these bright futures look like? The **Bright Futures Initiative** engages in science-informed visions of the future, where humanity’s grand challenges have been solved. We are leading a workshop process by which Oregon scientists and artists and the public can design bright futures based on the latest scientific understanding, and represent these futures using various artistic media and forms.
